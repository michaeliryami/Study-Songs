## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- An OpenAI API key (recommended) or Anthropic API key for lyrics generation
- A Replicate API key for music generation
- A Supabase account and project (for saving study sets)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

```bash
# For Lyrics Generation - OpenAI (recommended)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# OR for Anthropic/Claude
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
# LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic

# For Music Generation - Replicate (required for audio)
REPLICATE_API_KEY=your-replicate-api-key-here

# For Saving Study Sets - Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here
```

3. Set up your Supabase database table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sets (
  id int8 PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  subject text NOT NULL,
  jingles jsonb NOT NULL
);
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üé§ How to Use

1. **Enter a subject** (e.g., "Biology", "Calculus", "World History")
2. **Add up to 10 terms** (one per line) that you need to memorize
3. **Click "Generate Study Set"** to create jingles for each term
4. **Navigate through your study set** using the Previous/Next buttons
5. **Listen to each jingle** and let them drill into your memory
6. **Save your study set** to your Supabase database for later review

Each jingle will:

- **Define the concept** clearly and simply
- **Include specific facts, formulas, and details**
- **Use catchy rhymes and rhythm** for easy memorization
- **Have zero filler** - every word teaches something
